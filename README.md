#  RAG Chatbot

A simple **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** built with Python.  
This project demonstrates how to connect a **document store** (FAISS) with an **LLM (OpenAI GPT)** so the bot can answer questions based on your own data.

---

## Demo Flow
1. You load documents (PDFs or text files).  
2. The script **splits and embeds** them into a vector database.  
3. When you ask a question, the system:  
   - Retrieves the most relevant chunks  
   - Passes them + your question to GPT  
   - Returns a grounded answer with references  

---

## Features
- Simple and lightweight RAG pipeline  
- Uses **FAISS** for vector search  
- Works with **OpenAI Embeddings** + GPT models  
- Modular: `embedding.py` (indexing) and `chat.py` (chat interface)  
- Easy to extend with your own data  

---

##  Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-basic.git
   cd rag-basic
````

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add your OpenAI key:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"   # Mac/Linux
   setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-key-here"     # Windows
   ```

## Project Structure./..

```
rag-basic/
â”‚â”€â”€ documents/        # Your PDFs / text files
â”‚â”€â”€ embedding.py      # Script to embed documents into FAISS
â”‚â”€â”€ chat.py           # Chatbot script (retrieves + calls GPT)
â”‚â”€â”€ requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Embed your documents

```bash
python embedding.py
```

### Step 2: Start the chatbot

```bash
python chat.py
```

### Example:

```
You: What is this project about?
Bot: This project is a simple demo of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It uses FAISS for document search and GPT to generate grounded answers.
```

## Future Improvements

* Add a **web UI** with Streamlit or Gradio
* Support for **multiple document types** (Word, HTML, etc.)
* Add **citations** to show where answers come from
* Improve chunking strategy for long documents

ðŸ‘‰ Do you also want me to **generate the starter code (`embedding.py` + `chat.py`)** to go with this README so your GitHub repo is plug-and-play?
